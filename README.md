# motd
update motd on ubuntu-server

This script replaces the standard Ubuntu welcome message with a Helium logo and useful server information through modifying the MOTD files on the VPS.

**Usage:**

As root:
```
git clone https://github.com/akcryoptoguy/motd.git
cd motd
bash install-motd.sh
```

Changes will take effect immediately, so there is no need to reboot the VPS. Example:

Use at your own risk :)

With grandest thanks to Teela.
